rocDecode is a high-performance video decode SDK for AMD GPUs. Using the rocDecode API, you can
access the video decoding features available on your GPU.

> [!NOTE]
> The published documentation is available at [rocDecode](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocDecode/en/latest/index.html) in an organized, easy-to-read format, with search and a table of contents. The documentation source files reside in `projects/rocdecode/docs` in this repository. As with all ROCm projects, the documentation is open source. For more information on contributing to the documentation, see [Contribute to ROCm documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/contribute/contributing.html).

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
* **GPU**: [AMD Radeon&trade; Graphics](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html) / [AMD Instinct&trade; Accelerators](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `gfx908` or higher GPU required

### ROCm

Install ROCm using the package manager for your distribution by following the
official [Install AMD ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/install/rocm.html)
guide. Use the selector on that page to choose your GPU, operating system, and
install method. This is the recommended way to obtain ROCm and rocDecode for most
users.

The ROCm package repositories provide all of rocDecode's core dependencies,
including:

* HIP runtime and development libraries
* AMD Clang++ compiler (C++17 required)
* Libva and VA-API drivers
* Libdrm (amdgpu)
* CMake and pkg-config

rocDecode is also built and installed as part of
[TheRock](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock), which is the recommended path for
source builds and nightly/CI artifacts.

### Windows additional dependencies

On Windows, rocDecode uses the [vaon12](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/video-acceleration-api-va-api-now-available-on-windows/) backend (Mesa's VA-API on D3D12 translation layer) for hardware-accelerated decoding. The vaon12 driver and libva are provided by TheRock for Windows under `%ROCM_PATH%\lib\rocm_sysdeps`; no separate download is required. The following additional tools are needed:

* **Visual Studio 2022** version 17.13 or later with the C++ desktop workload (MSVC 19.43+, C++17).
  Earlier toolsets fail at link time because ROCm's prebuilt libraries reference C++ standard library
  internals introduced in MSVC 19.43 (see [TheRock Windows support](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/docs/development/windows_support.md)).
* **CMake** 3.21 or later (the `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator requires 3.21)
* **Windows SDK** (provides D3D12 and DXGI headers/libraries)

**Optional:**

* **FFmpeg** — pre-built libraries or built from source (required for FFmpeg-based samples and the host decoder library)

### FFmpeg (required for FFmpeg-based samples and extended tests)

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html) development libraries must be installed separately to build and run the FFmpeg-based samples and extended tests.

**Linux:**

  ```shell
  sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev
  ```

**Windows:**

  Use pre-built FFmpeg libraries or build from source. CMake finds FFmpeg automatically if it is
  installed in a common location — on `PATH`, under Chocolatey or scoop, in `%ProgramFiles%\ffmpeg`,
  or in `C:\ffmpeg`. Otherwise, pass `-DFFMPEG_ROOT=<path>` when configuring.

## Install

### Install with the package manager (recommended)

rocDecode is included with the ROCm Core SDK on Linux. A standard ROCm
installation using the `amdrocm-core-sdk` meta package installs the rocDecode
runtime library and development headers by default. Follow the official
[Install AMD ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/install/rocm.html) guide
and use the selector to choose your GPU, operating system, and install method.

If you only want the ROCm video decode components without the rest of the Core
SDK, the following standalone rocDecode packages are also available:

> [!NOTE]
> The `amdrocm-decode` package names apply to ROCm 7.13 and later. Earlier ROCm
> releases use different package naming.

| Package | apt name (Debian/Ubuntu) | dnf/zypper name (RHEL/SLES) | Contents |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| Runtime | `amdrocm-decode` | `amdrocm-decode` | Runtime library |
| Development | `amdrocm-decode-dev` | `amdrocm-decode-devel` | Library, headers, and CMake helper modules (`share/rocdecode/cmake/`) |
| Test | `amdrocm-decode-test` | `amdrocm-decode-test` | CTest verification, utility sources (`utils/`), samples, and test media |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The rocDecode library, headers, and the CMake helper modules
> (`/opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/cmake/`) come with a standard ROCm Core SDK install
> and the development package. However, the `utils/` utility sources, the
> `samples/` sources, and the test media under `/opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/` do
> **not** ship with the Core SDK or the development package. These are required to
> build applications against rocDecode and to build or run the samples and CTests,
> and are provided by the `amdrocm-decode-test` package. Install it if you build
> against rocDecode (for example, when building rocAL):
>
>   ```shell
>   # Debian / Ubuntu
>   sudo apt install amdrocm-decode-test
>
>   # RHEL / SLES
>   sudo dnf install amdrocm-decode-test
>   ```

### Build and install from source

rocDecode is built as part of [TheRock](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock) on both Linux and Windows. To build standalone from source:

### Linux

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems.git
cd rocm-systems/projects/rocdecode
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j8
sudo make install
```

### Windows

```bat
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems.git
cd rocm-systems\projects\rocdecode
mkdir build && cd build
set ROCM_PATH=<path-to-TheRock-build>
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release
```

> [!NOTE]
> * Set `ROCM_PATH` as an environment variable and use the same command prompt for the steps
>   below. CMake reads it from the environment, so no `-DROCM_PATH` is needed. Keep it set: the
>   VA-API headers and import libraries are found there at build time, libva reads it at run
>   time to locate the VA-API driver, and the test and sample commands below expand
>   `%ROCM_PATH%`.
> * FFmpeg is detected automatically when it is installed in a common location. Set
>   `FFMPEG_ROOT=<path-to-ffmpeg>` the same way only if it lives somewhere else, or to pin a
>   specific build; CMake reads that from the environment too. The commands below use
>   `%FFMPEG_ROOT%` to name the DLL directory for `PATH`, so set it either way if you plan to
>   copy them verbatim.
> * Don't quote the `set` lines themselves — `cmd.exe` would make the quotation marks part of the
>   value. Paths containing spaces are quoted where they are *used*, as in the commands here.

### Run tests

  **Linux:**

  ```shell
  make test
  ```

  **Windows:**

  Before running tests or samples, add the rocDecode, VA-API, and FFmpeg DLL directories to your PATH
  so that executables can locate the required DLLs at runtime. `ROCM_PATH` must stay set as well, so
  that libva can locate the VA-API driver:

  ```bat
  set PATH=%ROCM_PATH%\bin;%ROCM_PATH%\lib\rocm_sysdeps\bin;%FFMPEG_ROOT%\bin;%PATH%
  ctest -C Release
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The default test set runs without FFmpeg. The extended tests demultiplex containers through
  > FFmpeg, so they need the FFmpeg dev libraries and are off by default; configure the test
  > project with `-DENABLE_EXTENDED_TESTS=ON` to build and run them as well.

  > [!NOTE]
  > To run tests with verbose output, use `ctest -VV` (or `make test ARGS="-VV"` on Linux).

## Verify installation

After installation, the following files are available:

**Linux:**

* Libraries in `/opt/rocm/lib`
* Header files in `/opt/rocm/include/rocdecode`
* CMake helper modules in `/opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/cmake`
* Utility sources, samples, and test media in `/opt/rocm/share/rocdecode` (from the test package)
* Documents in `/opt/rocm/share/doc/rocdecode`

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `utils/` and `samples/` sources and the test media under
  > `/opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/` are provided by the `amdrocm-decode-test` package
  > (the CMake helper modules in `share/rocdecode/cmake/` ship with the development
  > package). Install `amdrocm-decode-test` (see [Install](#install)) if you build
  > against rocDecode or run the samples and CTests.

If you obtain rocDecode from [TheRock](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock)'s generic
(`.tar.zst`) artifacts instead of distribution packages, the `utils/`, `samples/`,
and test media under `share/rocdecode/` ship in the `rocdecode-test` artifact (for
example, `rocdecode_test_generic`) rather than `rocdecode-dev`. Install it with
TheRock's `install_rocm_from_artifacts.py` helper by adding `--tests` together with
`--rocdecode`:

  ```shell
  python build_tools/install_rocm_from_artifacts.py \
      --latest-release \
      --amdgpu-family gfx110X-all \
      --rocdecode \
      --tests
  ```

See TheRock's
[Installing artifacts](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/docs/development/installing_artifacts.md)
guide for other options.

**Windows:**

* Libraries in `%ROCM_PATH%\lib` and `%ROCM_PATH%\bin`
* Header files in `%ROCM_PATH%\include\rocdecode`
* Samples in `%ROCM_PATH%\share\rocdecode`

### Using sample application

**Linux:**

  ```shell
  mkdir rocdecode-sample && cd rocdecode-sample
  cmake /opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/samples/videoDecode/
  make -j8
  ./videodecode -i /opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/video/AMD_driving_virtual_20-H265.mp4
  ```

**Windows:**

  ```bat
  set ROCM_PATH=<path-to-rocm-installation>
  set FFMPEG_ROOT=<path-to-ffmpeg>
  set PATH=%ROCM_PATH%\bin;%ROCM_PATH%\lib\rocm_sysdeps\bin;%FFMPEG_ROOT%\bin;%PATH%
  mkdir rocdecode-sample && cd rocdecode-sample
  cmake "%ROCM_PATH%\share\rocdecode\samples\videoDecode"
  cmake --build . --config Release
  Release\videodecode.exe -i "%ROCM_PATH%\share\rocdecode\video\AMD_driving_virtual_20-H265.mp4"
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > `videoDecode` uses FFmpeg to demultiplex the container, so FFmpeg must be present at configure
  > time. `FFMPEG_ROOT` is only needed if FFmpeg is not in one of the locations CMake probes
  > automatically; it is used above to name the DLL directory for `PATH`. If you don't have FFmpeg
  > at all, use `videoDecodeRaw` instead — it reads an elementary bitstream and has no FFmpeg
  > dependency:
  >
  > ```bat
  > cmake "%ROCM_PATH%\share\rocdecode\samples\videoDecodeRaw"
  > cmake --build . --config Release
  > Release\videodecoderaw.exe -i "%ROCM_PATH%\share\rocdecode\video\AMD_driving_virtual_20-H265.265"
  > ```

### Using CTest

**Linux:**

  ```shell
  mkdir rocdecode-test && cd rocdecode-test
  cmake /opt/rocm/share/rocdecode/test/
  ctest -VV
  ```

**Windows:**

  ```bat
  set ROCM_PATH=<path-to-rocm-installation>
  set FFMPEG_ROOT=<path-to-ffmpeg>
  set PATH=%ROCM_PATH%\bin;%ROCM_PATH%\lib\rocm_sysdeps\bin;%FFMPEG_ROOT%\bin;%PATH%
  mkdir rocdecode-test && cd rocdecode-test
  cmake "%ROCM_PATH%\share\rocdecode\test"
  cmake --build . --config Release
  ctest -C Release -VV
  ```

## Samples

You can access samples to decode your videos in the
[samples](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/tree/develop/projects/rocdecode/samples) directory. Refer to the
individual folders to build and run the samples.

[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html) is required for the sample applications and the extended tests:

  ```shell
  sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev
  ```

## Tested configurations
