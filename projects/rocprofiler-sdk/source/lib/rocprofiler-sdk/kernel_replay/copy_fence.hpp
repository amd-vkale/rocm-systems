// The replay window drains the agent's AQL queues before it snapshots, but async copies run on
// SDMA engines, or on ROCr's internal blit queues, which neither that drain nor the per-agent
// replay lock sees. A copy in flight when the window snapshots is captured half-written, and the
// restores between passes then write that half-written snapshot back over bytes the copy has
// since delivered. The application later reads stale data and nothing reports it.
//
// With kernel replay configured, every async copy counts itself in flight on each agent it
// touches until its completion signal fires, and does not start while a replay window is open on
// any of those agents. A replay window opens the fence on its agent before it snapshots: new copies
// on the agent wait, and the window waits for the copies already in flight.

// declines replay for the dispatch.
